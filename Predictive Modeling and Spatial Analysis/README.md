In this repository, I present a spatial and economic analysis of the global industrial fishing industry, investigating how the enforcement of labor rights would impact the profitability of high-seas fleets. By modeling the economic shift from exploitative labor to fully enforced wages, I demonstrate that improved labor standards would significantly reduce profit margins in regions dominated by distant-water operations, particularly those with high risks of labor rights violations.

Data Science Skills Demonstrated

Vessel-Level Economic Modeling: Built a complex economic model to estimate total fishing costs (fuel, labor, and miscellaneous) and revenues (catch value and effort share) for individual vessels using global datasets.


Geospatial Analysis & Interpolation: Applied Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation to visualize and predict spatial variability in profitability changes across a 0.5° global ocean grid.


Machine Learning Integration: Leveraged outputs from advanced deep learning and neural network models (e.g., Global Fishing Watch’s fishing effort datasets and McDonald et al.’s labor risk predictions) to drive economic simulations.


Large-Scale Data Synthesis: Cleaned and merged disparate, multi-year datasets—including AIS movement patterns, satellite-derived fishing effort, and international labor wage data—to conduct a global-scale study.


Quantitative Policy Evaluation: Developed a "risk adjustment factor" to simulate the probability of wage enforcement and quantified the resulting percent change in overall profit per vessel-cell-year.
