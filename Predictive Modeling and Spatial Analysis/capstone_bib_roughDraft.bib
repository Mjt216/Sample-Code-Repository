	abstract={Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing costs billions of dollars per year and is enabled by vessels obfuscating their identity. Here, we combine identities of ~35,000 vessels with a decade of GPS data to provide a global assessment of fishing compliance, reflagging patterns, and fishing by foreign-owned vessels. About 17\% of high seas fishing is by potentially unauthorized or internationally unregulated vessels, with hot spots of this activity in the west Indian and the southwest Atlantic Oceans. In addition, reflagging, a tactic often used to obscure oversight, occurs in just a few ports primarily by fleets with high foreign ownership. Fishing by foreign-owned vessels is concentrated in parts of high seas and certain national waters, often flying flags of convenience. These findings can address the global scope of potential IUU fishing and enable authorities to improve oversight. A fusion of global open datasets advances the understanding of vessel identity and activity, and improves fisheries oversight.},

	journal={Nature Communications},

	number={1},
	pages={1612-11},
	abstract={AbstractLabor abuse on fishing vessels and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing violate human rights, jeopardize food security, and deprive governments of revenues. We applied a multi-method approach, combining new empirical data with satellite information on fishing activities and vessel characteristics to map risks of labor abuse and IUU fishing, understand their relationships, and identify major drivers. Port risks were globally pervasive and often coupled, with 57\% of assessed ports associated with labor abuse or IUU fishing. For trips ending in assessed ports, 82\% were linked to labor abuse or IUU fishing risks. At-sea risk areas were primarily driven by fishing vessel flags linked to poor control of corruption by the flag state, high ownership by countries other than the flag state, and Chinese-flagged vessels. Transshipment risk areas were related to the gear type of fishing vessels engaged in potential transshipment and carrier vessel flags. Measures at port offer promise for mitigating risks, through the Port State Measures Agreement for IUU fishing, and ensuring sufficient vessel time at port to detect and respond to labor abuse. Our results highlight the need for coordinated action across actors to avoid risk displacement and make progress towards eliminating these socially, environmentally and economically unsustainable practices.},

	journal={Marine policy},
	volume={69},
	pages={189-193},
	abstract={The aim of this paper is to provide an updated estimate of global fisheries subsidies. It builds on earlier estimates and methodologies to re-estimate and discuss the various types of subsidies provided by governments around the world. The results suggests that total subsidies were about USD 35 billion in 2009 dollars, which is close to the earlier estimate of 2003 subsidies once they are adjusted for inflation. Capacity-enhancing subsidies constituted the highest category at over USD 20 billion. For all regions, the amount of capacity-enhancing subsidies is higher than other categories, except for North America, which has higher beneficial subsidies. The analysis reveals that fuel subsidies constitute the greatest part of the total subsidy (22\% of the total), followed by subsidies for management (20\% of the total) and ports and harbors (10\% of the total). Subsidies provided by developed countries are far greater (65\% of the total) than those by developing countries (35\% of the total) even though the latter lands well above 50\% of total global catch. Asia is by far the greatest subsidizing region (43\% of total), followed by Europe (25\% of total) and North America (16\% of total). Japan provides the highest amount of subsidies (19.7\% of total), followed by the United States and China at 19.6\% of total. •Global fisheries subsidies were estimated at about USD 35 billion in 2009 dollars.•Harmful subsidies constituted the highest categories provided at over \$ 20 billion.•Harmful subsidies are highest category in all regions except North America.•Fuel subsidies are largest of the total subsidy at 22\%.•Subsidies contributed by developed countries are 65\% of the total.},

	title={Potential ecological and social benefits of a moratorium on transshipment on the high seas},
	journal={Marine policy},
	volume={81},
	pages={293-300},
	abstract={One way that illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fish catch is laundered into the seafood market is through transshipments at-sea. This practice, which often occurs on the high seas (the areas of ocean beyond national jurisdiction), allows vessels fishing illegally to evade most monitoring and enforcement measures, offload their cargo, and resume fishing without returning to port. At the same time, transshipment at-sea can facilitate trafficking and exploitation of workers who are trapped and abused on fishing vessels. This study gives an overview of high seas transshipment as well as evaluates transshipment at-sea regulations across 17 Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs), which are responsible for regulating fisheries on the high seas. Transshipment at-sea regulations have become increasingly strict in most RFMOs since the late 1990s. However, only five RFMOs have mandated a partial ban, and only a single RFMO, the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO), has mandated a total ban on transshipment at-sea. A total ban on transshipment at-sea across all RFMOs would support the ability of oversight and enforcement agencies to detect and prevent IUU fishing and also likely reduce human trafficking and forced labor on the high seas.},

	journal={New York Times},
	abstract={"Over the last two decades, China has built the world’s largest deep-water fishing fleet, by far, with nearly 3,000 ships. Having severely depleted stocks in its own coastal waters, China now fishes in any ocean in the world, and on a scale that dwarfs some countries’ entire fleets. The impact is increasingly being felt from the Indian Ocean to the South Pacific, from the coasts of Africa to those off South America -- a manifestation on the high seas of China’s global economic might. The Chinese effort has prompted diplomatic and legal protests. The fleet has also been linked to illegal activity, including encroaching on other countries’ territorial waters, tolerating labor abuses and catching endangered species."

They identify four key dynamics: industrial fleets can support local diets and incomes, but can also degrade ecosystems and displace small-scale fishers, often resulting in net food insecurity in dependent communities. Notably, the review highlights a major research gap: the lack of integration between rich industrial fishing datasets (e.g., catch, effort) and detailed household-level food security outcomes. This gap underscores the value of my spatially explicit profitability model, which leverages AIS-derived effort data and overlays socioeconomic variables to fill that methodological void.},

	abstract={WWF’s Oceans Futures platform offers predictive analytics to identify future fisheries conflict hotspots driven by climate-induced fish stock shifts and socio-political stressors. By integrating climate and fisheries models with data on nutrition, economics, foreign fishing presence, and contested maritime borders, the platform highlights regions—such as the Arctic, Gulf of Guinea, and Eastern Tropical Pacific—likely to experience increased conflict by 2030. This tool supports my research because it provides spatial insights into how climate change and governance challenges may impact the economic viability of high-seas fishing operations, particularly those reliant on low labor costs. Understanding these dynamics aids in assessing how labor rights enforcement and shifting fish distributions could reshape profitability patterns in the high seas.},

Using data envelopment analysis (DEA), the authors estimate technical efficiency and capacity utilization, showing strong correlations with vessel-level profitability. This approach supports my methodology by validating the use of effort-based metrics to infer changes in economic outcomes. It is particularly relevant to my analysis of high-seas fishing, where comprehensive economic data are often unavailable, yet spatial and effort data are accessible.},

(2018) use satellite data and machine learning to assess the economic viability of high-seas fishing, revealing that much of the activity would be unprofitable without substantial government subsidies and low labor costs. Their analysis highlights how profitability varies significantly by country, fishing method, and distance from port—core variables in my own spatial analysis. This study provides essential context for understanding the structural economic dependencies that sustain high-seas fishing, particularly the role of artificially suppressed labor costs. It directly supports my thesis by illustrating the fragile economic foundation of many distant-water fleets and the potential for labor rights enforcement to reshape profitability patterns.},
